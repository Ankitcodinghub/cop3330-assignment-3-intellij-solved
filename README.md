This assignment must be done using you IDEA IntelliJ Community Edition:

(https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) ). You will need to install and configure the software before starting. Instructions for how to do this, and tutorials for the software, can be found on the IntelliJ website (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/ (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/) ).

Programming Assignment 3 will consist of writing multiple short programs. You will write these programs from scratch, using the concepts covered so far.

An example structure of your GitHub repository might be:

Grades for this program will be determined according to the rubic. If your project on GitHub does not contain the complete IntelliJ project structure (i.e. the .iml file, .idea folder, your .java files, and your .class files), it will not be graded. This requirement is in place so that my graders can either pull your code directly from git or unzip it and run it without modification. Similarly, if your project does not run when we try and open it, it will not be graded. This is most likely to occur if you put all of your files in the same directory. By default, IntelliJ separates the source and binary files; so your GitHub repo should reflect this structure.

Problem 1

Problem 1 consists of multiple parts. You should finish one part and ensure that it works before moving to the next part. You will need to refactor (rewrite parts of) your code as you move between parts. Only your final program will be graded.

Part 1

The student then inputs the answer. Next, the program checks the student‚Äôs answer. If it‚Äôs correct, display the message ‚ÄúVery good!‚Äù and ask another multiplication question. If the answer is wrong, display the message ‚ÄúNo. Please try again.&gt;again.‚Äù and let the student try the same question repeatedly until the student finally gets it right. A separate method should be used to generate each new question. This method should be called once when the application begins execution and each time the user answers the question correctly.

Part 2

Modify the program from Part 1 so that various comments are displayed for each answer as follows:

Possible responses to a correct answer:

Possible responses to an incorrect answer:

No. Please try again.

Wrong. Try once more.

Don‚Äôt give up!

No. Keep trying.

Use random-number generation to choose a number from 1 to 4 that will be used to select one of the four appropriate responses to each correct or incorrect answer. Use a switch statement to issue the responses.

Part 3

Modify the program from Part 2 to use your question generation method to ask the student 10 different questions. Give students only one chance at answering each question. Count the number of correct and incorrect responses typed by the student. After the program has asked 10 questions, and the student types 10 answers, your program should calculate the percentage that are correct. If the percentage is lower than 75%, display ‚ÄúPlease ask your teacher for extra help.‚Äù, then reset the program so another student can try it. If the percentage is 75% or higher, display ‚ÄúCongratulations, you are ready to go to the next level!‚Äù, then reset the program so another student can try it.

Part 4

Modify the program from Part 3 to allow the user to enter a difficulty level. At a difficulty level of 1, the program should use only single-digit numbers in the problems; at a difficulty level of 2, numbers as large as two digits, and so on. Allow for four levels of difficulty.

Part 5

Modify the program from Part 4 to allow the user to pick a type of arithmetic problem to study. An option of 1 means addition problems only, 2 means multiplication problems only, 3 means subtraction problems only, 4 means division problems only and 5 means a random mixture of all these types.

Problem 2

Create class SavingsAccount. Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12‚Äîthis interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value.

Write a program to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two SavingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest for each of 12 months and print the new balances for both savers. Next, set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next month‚Äôs interest and print the new balances for both savers.
